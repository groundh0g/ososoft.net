## Back to the Books!

After nearly a year without progress, I've started working on [my MonoGame book]({{ site.baseurl }}/books/codecamps/) again. I've pitched the idea to a few publishers and I have a volunteer for tech editing. It looks like this will be a self-published work, though. MonoGame just doesn't have the same sex appeal as Unity.

In fact, that's the most common question when I present the idea -- Why not use Unity? So, I'll try to keep that in the back of my mind while churning out the text. There's no reason that the book can't be targeted to more (and less) popular frameworks. But, it's XNA that I used for my students, and MonoGame was a natural replacement when XNA got mothballed.
