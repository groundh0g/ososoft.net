## That New Site Smell!

[OsoSoft.net]({{ site.baseurl }}) is finally live!

As I work on the new books and open source projects, I'll be sure to add links and updates here.

This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using one 
of my OSS projects, [Jaytch](http://jaytch.org/) - a bootstrap-based template
and helper for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). My work is based on that of
[Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) by 
[@plusjade](https://github.com/plusjade/), but adds a metric crapton of new
widgets and snippets.
