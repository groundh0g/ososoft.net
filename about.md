<td><h2>What is OsoSoft.net?</h2>

<p>OsoSoft, LLC, is my second venture into independent contracting. My first LLC was founded in 2006 when I left my cushy W-2 job with no clients, no prospects, and no plan. That actually worked quite well for me. Word-of-mouth advertising drove more work my way than I could handle. In 2016, I sold the name and closed up shop. I had actually been back in the W-2 world for several years by that point.</p>

<p>OsoSoft marks a new life, in a new city, with a new way of working. I work from my home office in Newnan, Georgia, these days - 100 percent of the time.</p>

<p>That means that I get to spend more time with my kids while they're still kids. It's been nice seeing their games rather than just hearing about them. It's also nice to have the opportunity to work on projects with the brood, while drinking coffee (also brewed).</p>

<p>The majority of my professional time is spent writing code, but I also (rarely) provide corporate training and technical writing services. I'm a fairly new convert to the open source movement, and you're likely to come across some of those tinkerings on GitHub.</p>

He has several new books in the pipeline including a multi-volume series on MonoGame development using Xamarin Studio and a techno-thriller trilogy set in the not-so-distant future.</p>

<p>Joe lives with his wife and three daughters in Newnan, Georgia. Every summer, Joe teaches high school students how to write games during an intense weeklong course in North Carolina for <a href="http://landryacademy.com/families1/camps/">Landry Academy</a>. In his free time, Joe dabbles in sketching, cartooning, and creating 3D models. When you see <a href="http://groundh0g.deviantart.com/">his artistic creations</a>, youâ€™ll understand why he makes his living as a programmer.</p>
